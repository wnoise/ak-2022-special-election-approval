This is an attempt to look at what would have happened in the Alaska
2022 Special General election for Congress, had it been run using
approval, rather than the crazy IRV results that happened.

The votes are thrown into "types" based on the voting pattern (but not
names).  We assume that every first place vote would be an approval,
and every second place has the same probability of being approved, with
obvious adjustments taking place on oddly marked ballots.  Not all of the oddly marked ballots are handled, because I gave up most of the way through.

The upshot is under most scenarios, Begich would have won, though if no one wanted their second place, Peltola could have taken it.
